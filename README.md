# PiezoElectricSensors_Code
A function for extracting large signal peaks from piezo-electric sensors

This code is one of the functions used for analysing piezo-electric signals in the paper:
"Distinct dynamics of social motivation drive different patterns of social investigation behavior in C57BL/6J mice and Sprague Dawley rats"

The differences in social behavioral dynamics between C57BL/6J mice and SD rats (described in the paper above) may be due to distinct behavior of the social stimuli, which are enclosed within chambers, rather than the subjects themselves. To the best of our knowledge, the behavior of the social stimuli in similar tests has never been reported. To assess this behavior, we constructed a novel movement monitoring system, comprised of an array of piezo-electric sensors located at the floor of the triangular chamber containing the social stimulus. The code above normalize the signals and extract the large movements out of the raw data.
